# crtcon
This is a wrapper script to enumerate subdomain from crts, and dump domain information into /Domain folder in a txt file which can be used for further exploitation.

Folder /results will have all the misc data and cert IDs
Folder /Domain will have just the domain/sub-domain names in a txt file !
